# How do you configure a bucket for static website hosting?
  "To set up S3 for static website hosting, I first create a bucket and upload all the static files like index.html and style.css. Then, I enable static website hosting in the bucketâ€™s properties and set the index.html as the starting file.
Next, I configure permissions to allow public access by adding a bucket policy that grants read access to the objects. Finally, I use the website endpoint provided by S3 to access the hosted site. This makes the static website live and accessible to users."
