# Explain your project ?
"I created a static website using AWS S3 to store the website files and CloudFront to make the site
faster for users worldwide. I set up the S3 bucket to host the site and made sure it's secure by
controlling who can access it. Then, I connected CloudFront to the S3 bucket so the website content
could be delivered quickly from the nearest server. I also made sure only CloudFront could access
the S3 bucket, keeping it private. Finally, I tested the site to make sure everything was working properly."

# How would you explain your project to a non-technical stakeholder?
"I built a website that loads quickly and securely for users around the world. I used AWS S3 to store
the website files and CloudFront to ensure the website is fast, no matter where the user is located. I
made sure only authorized users can access the content by securing the websiteâ€™s connection. This
means the site is both fast and safe, improving the user experience."
