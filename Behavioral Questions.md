# Explain your project ?
"My project involved hosting a static website using AWS S3 and CloudFront. I set up S3 for static
website hosting, managed access policies, and ensured security. Then, I used CloudFront to improve
website performance and deliver content globally. I also implemented Origin Access Control (OAC)
to securely link CloudFront with the S3 bucket, preventing direct public access. Finally, I tested the
deployment by verifying access and ensuring secure access configurations were in place."
